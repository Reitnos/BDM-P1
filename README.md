# BDM-P1
Big Data Management and Analytics Project - Part 1

For our startup ScholarIA, we need a database full of academic papers and related information.
To do that, as a start we used two datasources: Semanticscholar and Scholarly API

Requirements:

Scholarly:
$ pip install scholarly
- Then, run the file named 'multiple-authors-papers.py'.
- It will generate 20 csv files in total from 10 different fields which are:
"ecology", "genetics", "management", "marketing","organic", "physical", 
"artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "criminal", "international".
- 2 csv's per field -> one shows author-paper relation, the other gives more information about paper.
